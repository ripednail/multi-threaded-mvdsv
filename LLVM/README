This is a compile of the mvdsv source with LLVM/cmake with OPEN CILK 3.0

You can download the opencilk binaries here: https://github.com/OpenCilk/opencilk-project/releases
Just extract to a directory and export the compiler to compile or run mvdsv

Example termianl command: export PATH=/home/vboxuser/Downloads/opencilk-3.0.0-x86_64-linux-gnu-ubuntu-24.04/bin/:$PATH

I have included the updated make file for SMPMVDSV as well to compile

So you'll just need to download the source if you want to compile or just run the binary and set the number of threads


export CILK_NWORKERS=4
./smpmvdsv
